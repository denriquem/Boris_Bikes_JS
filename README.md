```
As a cyclist,
So I can use a bike,
I would like a docking station to release a bike

As a potential cyclist,
so that I can use a good bike,
I would like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public,
So I can return the bikes i've hired,
I want to dock my bike at the docking station.

As a member of the public,
So I can decide whether to use the docking station,
I want to see a bike that has been docked.

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.
